Unity3D Terrain Generator Library
=================================

This is a Unity3D terrain generator library using Square/Diamond, Perlin Noise and other algorithms to create random terrains.

This project was originally created as a [Cities: Skylines mod](https://github.com/tomarus/cs-terraingen). This library is still a WIP and mainly started as a personal educational project. Cities: Skylines is a great game too and can be modded & debugged heavily.

To compile this library, simply clone the source in your Assets/Plugins folder in Unity3D. For usage refer to the [Cities: Skylines mod](https://github.com/tomarus/cs-terraingen).

More documentation and examples will follow.
